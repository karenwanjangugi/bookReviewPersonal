                <h2>Racism and Identity</h2>
                <h4>Author:Eyerusalem Yrga</h4>
                <div class="contentBlog">
                    <div>
                       
                        <p>
                            In her book Becoming, Michelle Obama explained how racism and sexism have affected her
                            family. Michelle’s grandfather, Dandy, who was born in 1912 in South Carolina, was deprived
                            of
                            going to college despite being excellent and intelligent, just because he was from a poor
                            family
                            and he was Black. He moved to Chicago to find a high-paying job, leaving racial oppression
                            in
                            South Carolina, but it was difficult to find a well-paying job without a union card (it was
                            impossible for Black people). Michelle also notes that her great-aunt Robbie faced
                            discrimination due to her race. Robbie sued Northwestern University for discrimination
                            because
                            she had registered for a workshop there but was not being allowed to have a room in the
                            women’s dorm and was denied getting an education.<br>

                            Michelle illustrated how racism continues to influence her family. For instance, when
                            Michelle’s
                            brother, Craig, received a new bike, he was immediately arrested by the police because they
                            assumed a young Black boy could not own a bike. The discrimination was also evident when
                            Michelle was admitted to Princeton University. People thought that she got it because of the
                            affirmative action, which is wrong and devalues the hard-earned work she has done.
                            The impact of racism and stereotypes becomes especially clear during Barack’s presidential
                            campaign and election. Rumors spread that Barack was a radical Muslim, and during his second
                            campaign and election, Barack faced challenges as there were conspiracy theories that
                            Barack's
                            Hawaiian birth certificate was fake. These criticisms are racist because they come from the
                            fact
                            that Barack is Black and has a name that sounds unfamiliar to many white people.
                            Michelle herself also faces prejudice because she is Black. People criticized Michelle for
                            her
                            choice of dressing and her speech. But she was strong enough to fight back against such
                            criticisms.<br><br>

                            Michelle Obama is a resilient and determined woman who believes in
                            accountability and taking full responsibility for every aspect of her life.
                            She is forced to balance responsibilities between her family, her husband's
                            political life, and her role as the first lady of the United States. She
                            acknowledges that it is not easy and requires making many compromises to
                            maintain balance and sobriety.<br>

                            Michelle falls in love with Obama and, despite their differences, she handles
                            their relationship in an ideally sophisticated manner. Michelle realises that
                            Obama does not mind messes, whereas she is a neat-freak and prefers being
                            orderly. When Obama leaves to go back to Harvard Law School, Michelle asks
                            Obama to call him frequently to keep in touch, but Obama insists on writing,
                            saying that he is “not much of a phone guy,”. She accepts, but makes sure
                            that they hear each other’s voices at least once in a while. The long-distance
                            relationship compromise is also seen where, after the wedding, Obama had a
                            deadline to finish his book to pay off his debts. His mother rents a cabin for
                            him for six months in Indonesia, causing Michelle to feel lonely for six months.
                            <br>


                            Michelle had had previous experiences in relationships having had her first
                            boyfriend in Princeton, Kevin, a hunky football star who was a ‘near
                            impossible combination of tall, sweet and rugged’. Their relationship ended
                            after Kevin decided to pursue a career as an NFL mascot. She also talks
                            about her first serious boyfriend, David, who smoked pot and held dates at
                            Red Lobster. <br>

                            Throughout all these relationships, Michelle taught herself how to embrace
                            different personalities in people as well as to live adapting to various lifestyle.
                            This ability to adapt to others would also help Michelle cope as a leader in various
                            organizations.<br><br>

                <h2>Friendships</h2>
                <h4>Author:Danait Semere</h4>
                <div class="contentBlog">

                    <div>
                        

                        <p>
                            Michelle Obama writes, ” Friendships between women, as any woman will tell you, are built of
                            a
                            thousand small acts of kindness… swapped back and forth and over again,” and she also
                            writes, “For
                            me, maintaining close friendships isn’t an option—it is a necessity.” I often refer to my
                            close
                            friends as my “kitchen table.” The friends at my table come from all different parts of my
                            life—
                            college, Chicago, DC, and every other period, too.

                            Having this perspective, Michelle and Jesse Jackson’s daughter, Santita Jackson, were very
                            close
                            buddies when they were young. Santita Jackson was eventually Michelle Obama’s maid of honor
                            at her wedding. 

                            Santita grew up with Jesse Jackson being her father, and once in a while, Michelle Obama
                            would
                            follow her to her father’s rallies. Michelle Obama recalls that at the time, she used to
                            marvel at
                            the idea of being the child of a political figure like Jesse Jackson.

                            At college, Michelle got a close friend called Suzanne Alele. She and Suzanne are poles
                            apart
                            despite their close friendship: she often prioritizes fun over making a practical choices.
                            Michelle
                            judges her for this, but when she passes away from an aggressive cancer at twenty-six,
                            Michelle
                            realizes that Suzanne’s way of doing things may have been right, and Michelle tries to find
                            more
                            fulfilling work in her life.

                            Michelle also met Valerie Jarrett in 1991, when she was deputy chief of staff at the Chicago
                            mayor’s office. She quickly became a trusted friend and adviser to both Michelle and Barack.

                            Overall, Michelle places a high value on friendship, which is why she has long-lasting
                            friendships
                            starting from her childhood.

                    <p>Michelle’s "Becoming" provides a clear perspective on leadership and politics, particularly as
                        experienced by a Black woman navigating predominantly white, male-dominated spaces. It
                        provides valuable insights into the realities of political life, the nature of leadership, and
                        the
                        personal impact of political decisions.<br>

                        1.&nbsp;Reluctance and Reality of Politics:
                        Michelle Obama candidly expresses her initial reluctance towards political life. She details her
                        concerns about the toll it would take on her family and her skepticism about the political
                        process.
                        However, she also demonstrates her commitment to public service and her willingness to engage in
                        politics when she believes it's necessary. is a Public Allies
                        The book portrays the realities of political life, including the intense scrutiny, the personal
                        sacrifices, and the often-harsh nature of political discourse.
                        <br>
                        2. &nbsp;Leadership as a Personal Journey:
                        "Becoming" emphasizes that leadership is not just about holding positions of power but also
                        about
                        personal growth, self-awareness, and authenticity.
                        Michelle Obama's leadership style is characterized by her empathy, her focus on community, and
                        her
                        commitment to creating opportunities for others.
                        The book highlights the importance of leading by example and staying true to one's values, even
                        in the
                        face of adversity.
                        <br>
                        3. &nbsp;The Intersection of Race, Gender, and Politics:
                        The book explores the unique challenges faced by Black women in politics, including the
                        stereotypes, the
                        biases, and the added pressure to represent their communities.
                        Michelle Obama's experiences as First Lady highlight the ways in which race and gender intersect
                        with
                        political power and influence.
                        She discusses the importance of representation and the need to create more inclusive political
                        spaces.
                        <br>
                        4. &nbsp;
                        The Human Side of Political Life:
                        "Becoming" humanizes the political process by showing the personal impact of political decisions
                        on
                        individuals and families.
                        Michelle Obama shares her experiences of balancing her roles as First Lady, wife, and mother and
                        the
                        challenges of maintaining a sense of normalcy in the White House.
                        The book highlights the importance of empathy and understanding in political leadership.
                        <br>
                        In essence:
                        "Becoming" presents a view of leadership and politics that is deeply personal, reflective, and
                        grounded
                        in the lived experiences of a Black woman. It's a story of navigating complex systems,
                        maintaining
                        integrity, and striving to make a positive impact, all while remaining true to oneself.

                        Loss of family Members<br>
                        Fraser Robinson III<br>
                        Michelle’s father’s death is the most emotionally significant loss. He had multiple sclerosis
                        and
                        never let the illness define him. Michelle and her family slowly watched their father
                        deteriorate,
                        but never had the conversation about his illness until he neared his death.
                        He was hospitalized in the end and died from a heart attack.
                        Michelle and her family dealt with the grief of losing their dad by crying and sometimes
                        laughing
                        because that is what he would have wanted.<br><br>

                        His death deepened her understanding of mortality and how little time they had.

                        Suzzane Alele
                        Suzanne was Michelle’s friend who died at the young age of 27 from cancer. Suzanne’s
                        unexpected illness and sudden death rattled Michelle in profound ways.
                        It catalyzed her realization that she hates being a lawyer and needs a career change. She
                        re-examined her judgement of Suzanne, finally making peace with her carefree way of life and
                        how fulfilled she had lived.<br>

                        Loss of black lives due to gun violence<br>
                        We see a lot of black people, young people, lose their lives to gun violence. These greatly tie
                        to
                        the theme of injustice in the black community.<br>

                        Hadia Pendleton, a 15-year-old honor student in Chicago, was shot and killed in Chicago Park
                        after being mistaken for a gang member.<br>

                        Hadia is among the young people who were victims of gun violence in the USA during Obama’s
                        time in office.<br>

                        Michelle talks about the emotional labour of comforting grieving families while maintaining a
                        public role.<br>
                        These moments strengthen her resolve to uplift and empower the youth.<br>

                        In Becoming, Michelle Obama beautifully illustrates her deep love and unwavering
                        support for her family, especially her father. Despite his struggle with multiple sclerosis,
                        their relationship remained strong, marked by deep respect, affection, and unspoken
                        understanding. Michelle admired his quiet strength and dignity, and in return, she
                        showed her love through care and attentiveness helping him with tasks, walking slowly
                        beside him, and always making sure he felt included and respected. She never saw him
                        as weak, but as a hero who inspired her to be strong, compassionate, and determined.
                        Her actions reflected the deep bond they shared, and her close knit family, rooted in love
                        and resilience, became the foundation of her strength and identity.    
                    
                        Michelle describes her childhood home on the South Side of Chicago a small apartment
                        where she, her brother Craig, and their parents lived close together, often hearing each
                        other through the walls. Despite the modest space, it was filled with warmth, love, and
                        strong values. Her parents, Fraser and Marian, worked hard to give their children a good
                        life, teaching them to speak up, stay grounded, and believe in their worth. That tiny
                        upstairs apartment, with its closeness and care, laid the foundation for Michelle's deep
                        sense of family, resilience, and purpose. It’s a powerful reminder that love and strength
                        often grow strongest in the humblest of homes. 
        
                        Their relationship with their daughters, Malia and Sasha, was filled with intentional care,
                        warmth, and presence, despite the demands of public life. The moment that reveals their
                        priorities as parents was when Malia fell seriously ill as a baby. Michelle recalls how
                    
        
                       Barack, despite his busy schedule, dropped everything to be by their side at the hospital.
                        That moment showed her that he wasn’t just ambitious and driven he was also a deeply
                        committed father who put family first. Together, Michelle and Barack made sure their
                        daughters felt grounded, loved, and supported, shielding them as much as possible from
                        the pressures of fame while giving them a stable and nurturing home. 
        
                        Michelle Obama beautifully expresses the importance of family through the deep bond
                        shared across three generations. When Michelle and Barack had to travel or focus on
                        demanding responsibilities, her mother, Marian Robinson, stepped in not just as a
                        caregiver, but as a constant source of love, wisdom, and stability for Malia and Sasha.
                        By moving into the White House with them, Marian ensured that the girls were
                        surrounded by family, not just formality. She treated them with quiet strength and
                        nurturing care, offering a sense of normal life in an extraordinary setting. Her presence
                        reminded them and the world that no matter how high the stage, family remains the
                        foundation. Through Marian's support, Michelle and Barack were able to lead, knowing
                        their daughters were safe, loved, and deeply rooted in the values of home and kinship.
