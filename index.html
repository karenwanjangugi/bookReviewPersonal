                This name is a reflection of how, Trevor Noah grew up as the child to two different races regarded as black 
                and white in South Africa's Apartheid era.

                <h4>Identity During Apertheid</h4>
                <p>
                    If I could give Born a Crime a new title, it would beat“ Identity During Apartheid”. The word
                    “Identity” describes finding out who you are. ”Apartheid was a system of racial segregation enforced
                    by the white minority government in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. The reason that “Identity During
                    Apartheid” would be the title of the book is because of apartheid it was difficult for Trevor to
                    have an answer to “who am I?”.
                    He was born to a white father, Robert, and his mother, Patricia, which didn’t fit into the
                    government's laws. The book shows his struggle with this. The word “Apartheid” puts the story in a
                    specific time and place, so readers can easily know what kind of challenges Trevor faced.

                <h4>In between Child</h4>
                <p>This is a suitable title because<br>
                     of the themese explored in the book. It is a memoir of a young boy
                    , an anamoly,who faces struggles of not belonging to either race, class, 
                    culture or school.
                     His conception and birth 
                     is the first divide we see,
                      a child born from a white Swiss dad and a black Xhosa woman. He is neither black nor white. He is termed colored, but throughout the book we see how even the colored community rejected him.</p>

                        <h4>Illegally Alive</h4>
                        <p>I choose it because Trevor was born<br> 
                            illegally like the same story of born a crime<br>...
                            he was illegally born and suffered to live 
                            as a normal human until the apartheid comes to end.</p>

                        <h4>Noyumbiselo's Legacy</h4>
                        <p>
                            From the shadows of a forbidden birth to the global stage we all know, 
                            one name echoes with the strength, resilience, and unwavering love that shaped a
                             comedic genius: Patricia Nombuyiselo. You know Trevor Noah as the sharp-witted host
                              who effortlessly navigates cultural nuances and political satire. You might know his
                               incredible story of growing up in apartheid South Africa, a child born into a world that 
                               deemed his very existence a crime. But at the heart of this extraordinary journey lies the 
                               enduring legacy of his mother, Nombuyiselo.
